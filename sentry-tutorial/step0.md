**Sentry.io** is an open-source platform that provides self-hosted and cloud-based error monitoring to help software teams discover and prioritize errors in real-time. Sentry tracks errors in all majors languages and frameworks (like Node.js, PHP, C#, Java, Go, React, Angular, Vue, JavaScript), and it is also possible to integrate Sentry with many different apps/services. For example, we will show you how to integrate Sentry with Slack! The Sentry.io developer accounts are free, but there also exist commercial options for larger teams.

The term cloud in *cloud-based error monitoring*, refers to a set of web-hosted applications that stores and allows access to data over the Internet - instead of on the hard drive of your computer. Cloud monitoring is the process of monitoring and managing the workflow within this cloud-based infrastructure or platform, to ensure that the cloud infrastructure performs at its best. Error monitoring platforms, like Sentry.io, exist to rise problems in production and beyond. In that way, it is more simple for developers to build quality software, since the error monitoring provides insight into the cause of software errors. 

**So how is error monitoring related to DevOps?** DevOps creates more visibility between teams and processes, which definitely is relevant in the discovery and resolution of errors that affect the end-users. Thus, error monitoring platforms like Sentry.io, fit perfectly into a DevOps environment since it contributes to the communication, and mitigates the risk of software errors getting into the customerâ€™s hands in the first place. Error monitoring provides more visibility into the cause and effect of a certain problem, making it possible to solve the problem with more speed and accuracy (since there is no need to search through error logs). This is useful for DevOps-teams in order to deliver at speed, get feedback from production and also increase the satisfaction of the customers. 

The picture below illustrates the DevOps Lifecycle, and as you can see, monitoring is a part of it.
