After you completed the previous step, which includes setting up a project in Sentry, you can go to your profile at https://sentry.io/. Start by clicking on **Projects** and choose the one that you just created. Scroll down the page and click on Client Keys (DSN).

DSN is a value that stands for Data Source Name. It looks a lot like a standard URL, but itâ€™s actually just a representation of the configuration required by the Sentry SDKs. It consists of a few pieces, including the protocol, public key, the server address, and the project identifier. You can see your DSN value on the page Client Keys. Below is an example of how it should look. The text that is marked in yellow represents the `KEY` and the `PROJECT` value that you will need, but you should use the ones that are shown at your own Profile.

You should init the Sentry browser SDK as soon as possible during your application load up, before initializing React. Therefore, you will need to modify the **App.js** file, which can be done via the editor. Go to `sample-app/src/App.js`{{open}}. 

You then need to add this code block under the other import-statements, but replace `KEY` and `PROJECT` to what is shown at you profile on Sentry.io. 

```javascript

  import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
  Sentry.init({ dsn: 'https://**KEY`**@sentry.io/**PROJECT**'}); 
 
```

After you have added the code, you can continue.
